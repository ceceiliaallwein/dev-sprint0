# Text answers from Week 0

# Name:



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer: 

Line 9 imports the classes (and their functions) from TurtleWorld 
Line 10 creates a new instance of the TurtleWorld() class and assigns it to the variable 'world'
Line 11 creates a new instance of the Turtle() class and assigns it to the variable 'bob'
Line 12 calls a function from the World class (a parameter for TurtleWorld) within the current environment (GUI, which is a parameter of World()) that halts python (with the MainLoop() constructor) until there's further interaction from the keyboard. 




These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer:
t = Turtle, str
n = number of sides, int
l = length of each side, int

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer:
fd()
rt()

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer:





Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer:

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:

-- What is this type of requirement called?
